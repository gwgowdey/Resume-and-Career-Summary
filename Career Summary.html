    <b><u>Career Summary</u></b>
</p>

<p>
    I was born in Greenwich, CT and lived in Larchmont, NY until I was 6 years 
    old before my family and I moved to Naples, FL. I was raised there until my
    high school graduation in 2012. I attended Florida State University (FSU) from 
    June 2012 until December 2017. I finished a B.S. in Exercise Physiology in July 
    2016 and a M.S. in Sport Management in December 2017.
</p>

<p>
    My original career goal while an undergrad student at FSU was to pursue a career in
    physical therapy. I started to apply to physical therapy schools and unfortunately could 
    not meet the financial requirements to attend. I started to look around at some different
    career options after that and found the M.S. in Sport Management program also at FSU. 
    Given my previous coursework in exercise and physical activity, I hoped to expand upon 
    my knowledge of that area and pursue a career in sports. The program was also very reasonably 
    priced and offered numerous working opportunities.
</p>

<p> 
    In high school and college, I worked part-time for Abercrombie and Fitch as a Floor 
    Model from 2012 to 2015. Also in college from 2016 until my graduation, I worked 
    part-time at Vale Food Co. as a Delivery Driver for their meal plan service. I also 
    completed a number of unpaid internships and/or shadowing opportunities at various 
    physical therapy clinics while preparing to apply for physical therapy graduate school.
</p>

<p>
    While in graduate school at FSU and trying to break into the sports industry, I
    was a Graduate Teaching Assistant with the <a href = "https://education.fsu.edu/sport-management-grad">
    FSU Department of Sport Management</a> for the Spring 2017 semester. I taught two 
    PEM1131 - Basic Weight Training courses and one PEM1121 - Stretch and Relaxation course. 
    For the Summer 2017 semester I returned home and worked for <a href = "https://www.perfectgame.org">
    Perfect Game</a> as a Scout/Field Manager. In the Fall 2017 semester and my final one at FSU, I worked for 
    <a href = "https://saas.fsu.edu"> FSU Student-Athlete Academic Services</a> as an Educational Services Assistant.
</p>

<p>
    My goal after college was to obtain a video or "4th Coach" position with an MLB team. I went
    to the 2017 Winter Meetings in Orlando, FL to search and interview for jobs. I accepted
    a position as a Minor League Technology Apprentice with the Houston Astros a couple
    of days after the end of the Winter Meetings. I was assigned to their 
    <a href = "https://spark.adobe.com/page/qQNsANQhBYsIH">High-A minor league affiliate</a>
    in Buies Creek, NC and lived there from April 2018 to October 2018. At the Winter Meetings where 
    I interviewed for the Astros, I went to an on-site job fair and submitted my resume for positions with the 
    Toronto Blue Jays at their <a href = "https://www.milb.com/dunedin">Spring Training</a> center in Dunedin, FL. 
    Since I didn't start  work for the Astros until April 2018, I was looking for employment from January 2018 to March 2018. 
    The Blue Jays had a Coordinator, Spring Training position open during that exact time frame, so 
    I interviewed for that position a week after my graduation at FSU. I accepted the offer soon after.
</p>

<p>
    I was searching for further work in the baseball industry after completing the Astros' 
    position and found a Research & Development Intern role with <a href = "https://www.drivelinebaseball.com"
    >Driveline Baseball</a>. This job allowed me to start as soon as possible once the Astros' 
    position ended, so I applied, interviewed, and accepted the job offer. I moved to the greater Seattle 
    area shortly after. I was a Research and Development Intern from November 2018 to March 2019. I moved 
    into a full-time role as a Coordinator of Hitting Research due to my interest in working with the Hitting 
    staff. I was in that role from April 2019 to July 2019. Next, I became Coordinator of Technical Education 
    to help with Driveline's coaching certification programs and new employee education initiatives.
</p>

<p>
    Ultimately, my goal was to work full-time in a Baseball Operations role for an MLB team. While
    searching for those types of positions, I came across the Support Coordinator, Baseball Systems job
    posting with the Texas Rangers. I applied for the position and accepted the offer in late 2019.
    I resigned from Driveline Baseball shortly after and moved to Fort Worth, TX where I currently live.
    In this position, I was responsible for technical support and user education for their internal 
    proprietary Baseball Operations website.
</p>

<p> 
    My position was eventually eliminated by the Texas Rangers' ownership group at the end of 2020 season.
    I decided to go back to school because of this. I began the <a href = "https://www.tccd.edu/academics/courses-and-programs/programs-a-z/credit/information-technology/programming">
    IT: Programming Certificate/Associate of Applied Science</a> degree at Tarrant County College in the Fall 2020 semester. 
    I plan to complete the program in December 2021. I'll be taking 2 to 3 online classes each semester until I finish. 
    I also began work as a part-time virtual Math Tutor with their Northeast Campus Math and Physics Learning Center for a work-study academic program. 
    I also work full-time with <a href = "https://www.hsoproserv.com">HSO ProServ</a> as an Associate Technical Consultant specializing in Microsoft
    Dynamics 365. I started working there in July 2021.
