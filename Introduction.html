<b>
Introduction.
</b>

<p>
Greetings, and I hope this finds you well. Welcome to my Github page.
My name is Griffin Gowdey, and I'm currently a part-time online student
at Tarrant County College (TCC) studying IT: Programming 
(tccd.edu/academics/courses-and-programs/programs-a-z/credit/information-technology/programming/). 
I'm also a part-time virtual Math Tutor at TCC's Northeast Campus Math and Physics
Learning Center. My GitHub page currently contains assignments from my past course
work at TCC and some past R&D projects. My goal over the next couple of months
is to expand upon it by adding my TCC capstone project, future course work, more advanced 
R&D projects, and a professional portfolio/sales website that I'm creating for an acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
My background work history has been in sports, education, customer support, data 
analysis, and technical project management. I've held various IT related roles 
throughout my career and am looking to move exclusively into software development. 
I'm currently searching for a technical position to supplement my present course work 
and plan to use my GitHub as a showcase for potential employers. I'm available
to start work as soon as possible. My part-time virtual Math Tutor position shifts
are in the evenings a couple of times a week to qualify for a work-study program with
TCC. I work no more than 19.5 hours/week. My schedule is very flexible and can be 
rearranged if offered a full-time position that would potentially conflict.
